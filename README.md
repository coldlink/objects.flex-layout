#Flex Layout

Flex layout is a ployfill for and based on the standard inuitcss [layout-object](https://github.com/inuitcss/objects.layout) by [Harry Roberts](https://github.com/csswizardry).

It provides a modifier class to easily get layout-items sharing the same height on each row.

Install using Bower:

    $ bower install --save inuit-flex-layout
